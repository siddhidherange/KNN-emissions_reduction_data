# KNN-emissions_reduction_data
Emissions Reduction Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors A machine learning project using Python to classify emissions reduction potential based on energy metrics. This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to categorize data based on energy efficiency, renewable ratios, and technology costs.
